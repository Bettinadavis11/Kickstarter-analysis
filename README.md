# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project, we will anticipate campaign outcomes based on the data provided.


### Purpose
Louise’s play “Fever” came close to its fundraising goal rather quickly, and she would like to know how other campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In our analysis, we have determined that the best month to launch a theater campaign would be the month of May, as 111 campaigns were successful, making it a 67%.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We have determined that if a play goal is less than 1000 has a 76% success rate compared to plays ranging between 1000 to 4999 with a success rate of 73%. However, the amount of success plays ranging less than a 1000 to 1000 to 4999 equals to 529, making the ranges of 1000 to 4999 74% successful between those 2 ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I would say that the only difficulty I encountered was getting the correct formula. I filtered the Kickstarter page to display only the “plays” subcategory, however, the results were not accurate. Once I added “plays” to the formula, my table populated the correct ranges.

## Results

- I think the information on the Outcomes Based on Launch Date is clear, however, I think I would have benefitted from adding an additional row showing percentages as it would make our data clearer to Louise.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I feel the information provided on the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet is noticeably clear, and it will provide Louise in-depth data to compare her play to all the other plays. 

- I believe that a limitation of this dataset would be that is incredible big, and if you are not familiar with the formulas and how to filter the desired data, would make it very hard for whoever it trying to analyze this dataset.

- I think we would need to add more information to the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date. I think we would need to add also columns for percentage Successful, Failed and Canceled.
Please see below table for my recommendations.
